# Archived Code

Development on Rootski began in 2018. Since that time, it has evolved through several stages
using different technologies. This folder contains deprecated, experimental, or unfinished
code that is not currently used in the Rootski app.

Keeping the archived code isolated from the rest of the project helps keep the repository
uncluttered.

Significant effort has gone into all of the code in this archive, and it could potentially be
useful at a future time.
