title HTTP-01 ACME Challenge
actor "Rootski Engineer" as Dev
footer
Note that LetsEncrypt has to be able to reach the server where Traefik
is running. That means that this challenge won't work if you are running
Traefik on a home server and don't have your port forwarded. If you need
to be able to run Traefik on a local network that is inaccessible from outside
the network, you'll need to use the DNS-01 challenge.
