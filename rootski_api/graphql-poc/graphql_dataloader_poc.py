# it's good to have these IDs (the keys) be strings because GraphQL usually thinks
# of IDs as strings. I believe the reason for this is because UUIDs are often the ID
# style of choice for GraphQL. One purpose of GraphQL is to be able to query and join
# data from multiple sources--including multiple databases. If you have two databases
# that need to cooperate with each other, it's helpful to have IDs be UUIDs. The title
# of this article is a bit strong, but it covers the main reasons for UUIDs in the db world:

# --- Strawberry GraphQL Types --- #
####################################

# Naming the strawberry classes "<type>Type" frees up the non-suffixed name ("<type>")
# for other models. However, normally this problem is solved by putting:
#
# pydantic models in a schemas module (namespace) -- schemas.Tag
# orm/odm/ogm models in a orm/odm/ogm module (namespace) -- orm.Tag
# strawberry models in a graphql module (namespace) -- gql.Tag
#
# I prefer that approach because it makes it easier to see which model you're
# using in a given file without having to scroll up to the imports. Saves time!
#
# Having pydantic models could be useful for making abstract data loaders.
# It looks like there are reasons you don't want to have a dataloader return
# a strawberry object directly (I could be wrong on that), but if dataloaders
# return pydantic models AKA *not* orm/odm/ogm models, then our data access is
# abstracted away which means we can freely interchange/mix databases simply by
# swapping out individual dataloaders. Very cool!
#
# So many models... so little time! ðŸ¤£
