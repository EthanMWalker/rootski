# to ignore an error using flake8, add a line like this
# noqa: <error code>
# where <error code> is a short code like D107

# note that flake8 supports installing many other linting tools as plugins; we currently
# are using flake8-docstrings which is a plugin that integrates pydocstyles with flake8.
# pydocstyles is a linter that checks docstrings for style issues.

[flake8]
ignore=
    # (pydocstyle) requires docstring in __init__, often this is trivial
    D107,

    # (pydocstyle) Multi-line docstring summary should start at the first line
    D212,

    # line too long; black catches this
    E501,
