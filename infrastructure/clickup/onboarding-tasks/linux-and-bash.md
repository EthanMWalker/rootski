# ðŸ”¥ Learn Linux and bash

## Project Context

Linux is awesome. Bash is awful. ZSH makes bash great (but that's another task).

There's no way you'll be able to contribute to any part of Rootski without being
really comfortable in the command line and Linux.

Make sure you understand *all* of the concepts referred to in the `Linux and bash`
section of the `Developer Tools & Collaboration` page. It has some good resources for you.
Good luck!

## Project Requirements

1. Set up a Linux development environment according to the `Linux and bash` portion of `Developer Tools & Collaboration`.

2. Go through each of the concepts on the `Linux and bash` page. Research and understand each of them.

3. (Bonus) Do a video call with someone else on the team to ask/answer questions about
   these points. This can be a get-to-know-you activity that helps you have a fun time
   collaborating with them in the future. Discussing these in slack is good, too.
