# ðŸ”¥ Run Rootski Locally

## Project Context

Getting Rootski to actually run on your machine is a *major* milestone.

If you're a fairly experienced Python/docker developer, it should be no problem.

If you are new to these things, that's okay. You'll just need to learn a bit.
There is a page on the knowledge base called `Developer Tools & Collaboration`.
There is a for each heading on that page, there is an onboarding task in ClickUp for you.

There is a checklist of tools to install and commands to run on the README here: https://github.com/rootski-io/rootski.

If it seems like too much to try to get Rootski running right now, that's okay. Go
do some of the other onboarding cards and come back to this.

See the `Get Rootski running on your local machine` heading on that page
for resources on getting this done.

## Project Requirements

1. Start up Rootski using `make run`.

2. Make sure you can visit the web UI on `localhost` in your browser.

3. Make sure you can get to the word page using the search bar.
