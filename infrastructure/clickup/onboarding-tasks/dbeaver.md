# ‚≠ê Set up DBeaver

## Project Context

DBeaver is a neat desktop tool for working with SQL databases.

For working on the backend, you will need to install DBeaver and verify
that you can connect to the Rootski database locally. There is a tutorial/demo
of how to do this in the Quickstart video on the YouTube playlist.

## Project Requirements

1. Download DBeaver.

2. Successfully connect to the Rootski database running locally and browse the tables.
