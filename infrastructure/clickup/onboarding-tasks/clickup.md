# ðŸ”¥ Get Access to ClickUp and learn TBD

## Project Context

ClickUp is our project management tool. It's a competitor to Jira and it is *awesome*.

Working with ClickUp will be a highly valuable experience as it as almost ALL software
teams use Jira to keep track of work in progress and plan their roadmap.

Reach out to Eric so he can send you an invite link and assign cards to you.

## Project Requirements

1. Get a ClickUp invite link from Eric and join our ClickUp team.

2. Watch the two Git tutorials to learn how we use ClickUp and `git` for Trunk-based Development (TBD).
   Follow along by using THIS CARD to create a branch and add your name to the contributors section of the `README.md`
   file in the repo. Open up a PR and ask the team to review it on `#onboarding-and-training`.

3. Post in `#onboarding-and-training` an explanation of Trunk-based development in your own words.

Note that the knowledge base states that you are done onboarding when you complete your first PR. This one
doesn't count towards that, but it is still a massive milestone that will help you get comfortable with the PR
process.
