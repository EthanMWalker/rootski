# ðŸ”¥ Set up Slack

## Project Context

Join Slack using the link on the homepage of the [knowledge base](https://docs.rootski.io/).

The team is *really* cool. Please introduce yourself!

## Project Requirements

1. Use the invite link to join our Slack channel

2. In #general, introduce yourself to the team answering these questions. We try to keep these informal and fun ðŸ˜ƒ

   - Where are you from?
   - Where are you now?
   - How long have you been coding/writing software/doing data science/doing what you do?
   - Did you go to school or do any other type of training?
   - Which parts of Rootski are exciting to you?
   - What are some of your career and life goals?
   - How fast/slow would you like to onboard and contribute (roughly, it changes for all of us)

3. In the "What I Do" section of your profile, enter your email address so we can see it when we hover over your name. It's best if this is the email you use for GitHub and ClickUp.

4. Add a profile picture.
