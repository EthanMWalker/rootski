# üî• Set up VS Code

## Project Context

The primary editor our team uses for development is VS Code. It's fine to use another editor as well.
Eric often switches between PyCharm and VS Code for work depending on what he is working on.

Specifically, we use VS Code for pair programming.

VS Code is *awesome*, but there is definitely a learning curve to set it up.

Go through the `üî•/‚≠êÔ∏è VS Code or PyCharm` section of in the [Developer Tools & Collaboration](https://quickest-trail-808.notion.site/Developer-Tools-Collaboration-d195c1d6c0f14643b370a9ceff323e75) page.

## Project Requirements

1. Install VS Code.

2. Install each of the recommended extensions. Edit the `.vscode/settings.json` for any customizations you want.

3. (python developers only) Connect VS Code to a Python virtual environment

4. Edit the `.vscode/settings.json` so that your file auto formats when you save. For python developers,
   use `black` as the formatter.

5. Run a piece of code with the debugger and make it stop at a breakpoint. Please get comfortable with this.
   You will need to create a `.vscode/launch.json` to do this.
