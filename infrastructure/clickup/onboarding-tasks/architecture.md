# ⭐ Understand the Rootksi Architecture

## Project Context

> 🗒 Note 1: This task still uses the [old knowledge base website](https://quickest-trail-808.notion.site/Rootski-Architecture-9892c9f2159e4865a4438c163e235c41). Sorry for the confusion
> of having two sites! We're in the process of migrating the Notion site to
> [docs.rootski.io](https://docs.rootski.io/). The [high-level architecture page](https://docs.rootski.io/rst/architecture/index.html) in the new site is the most up to date. The subpages of the old site are also up to date.

It's important that you understand the whole architecture of rootski at a high-level, even
if you won't be contributing to every part.

Please read the [rootski architecture page](https://docs.rootski.io/rst/architecture/index.html#architecture-tech-stack) and each of the subpages of [the old architecture page](https://quickest-trail-808.notion.site/Rootski-Architecture-9892c9f2159e4865a4438c163e235c41). Also watch any of
the YouTube videos embedded there from our YouTube playlist. You can find a link to
the YouTube playlist on the [knowledge base homepage](https://docs.rootski.io).

Depending on your interests, you may want to spend extra time looking into the resources
in the subpages, but there's no need to go deep into all of them.

Specializing in one or more of those areas will be in the scope of other tasks.

## Project Requirements

1. Read all of the rootski architecture pages.

2. Watch any videos from our playlist that show up in those subpages.

3. Walk another person through each aspect of our architecture diagram in our own words.
   If you notice this exposes any gaps in your understanding of the big picture, capture them
   and ask in `#onboarding-and-training`.
