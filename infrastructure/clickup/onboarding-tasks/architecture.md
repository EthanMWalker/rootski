# ⭐ Understand the Rootksi Architecture

## Project Context

It's important that you understand the whole architecture of Rootski at a high-level, even
if you won't be contributing to every part.

Please read the `🌩️ Rootski Architecture` page and each of the subpages. Also watch any of
the YouTube videos embedded there *that are from our YouTube playlist*.

Depending on your interests, you may want to spend extra time looking into the resources
in the subpages, but there's no need to go deep into all of them.

Specializing in one or more of those areas will be in the scope of other tasks.

## Project Requirements

1. Read all of the `🌩️ Rootski Architecture` and subpages.

2. Watch any videos from our playlist that show up in those subpages.

3. Walk another person through each aspect of our architecture diagram in our own words.
   If you notice this exposes any gaps in your understanding of the big picture, capture them
   and ask in `#onboarding-and-training`.
