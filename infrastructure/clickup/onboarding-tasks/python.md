# ðŸ”¥ Set up Python

## Project Context

To run Rootski locally, you're going to need Python installed on your machine.

If you *really* only want to work on the frontend and never want to have anything
to do with the backend or infrastructure, talk to Eric. We can find a way to make
it possible to run the app without a good Python install on your machine.

You will need to set up and learn TWO things for this task to be complete.

- `pyenv` -- see the `pyenv` section of the [Developer Tools & Collaboration](https://quickest-trail-808.notion.site/Developer-Tools-Collaboration-d195c1d6c0f14643b370a9ceff323e75) document
- virtual environments -- see the `Python Virtual Environments` section of the [Developer Tools & Collaboration](https://quickest-trail-808.notion.site/Developer-Tools-Collaboration-d195c1d6c0f14643b370a9ceff323e75) page.
