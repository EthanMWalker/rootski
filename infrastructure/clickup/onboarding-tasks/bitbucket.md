# ðŸ”¥ Get access to Bitbucket

## Project Context

To work on Rootski... you're going to need to have the Rootski codebase available.

We use Bitbucket for our Git host. Unfortunately, Bitbucket is not free for teams larger than 5 people.

Bitbucket costs $3 per user per month. If you aren't working on the codebase, it's possible you
can get away with not having access to Bitbucket. Otherwise, please get Eric's Venmo information.
Eric will pay the bill monthly, and you can pay him back.

By default, Eric will keep everyone deactivated until they explicitly ask to be added to Bitbucket.
This will help keep us with as few contributors as possible in case we ever dip below 5 active contributors...
which would make Bitbucket FREE again :D

If you are planning to take a month off from actively contributing. Let Eric know and he will remove you
so you won't need to pay.

## Project Requirements

1. Get Eric's Venmo information

2. Pay Eric $3

3. Log that you paid Eric for your first month in our spreadsheet (find the link in the knowledge base)

4. Follow up with Eric to make sure you get a Bitbucket invite link.

5. Clone the git repo with SSH. You may need to generate an SSH key pair. See the instructions in the knowledge base.
   For this to work, you will need to add your public key (`id_rsa.pub`) contents to your Bitbucket account under
   `Your Profile Picture` > `Personal Settings` > `SSH Keys` > `Add Key`.
