# 🔥 Set up GitHub

## Project Context

The rootski codebase is on GitHub.

You can find a link to the repository on the [knowledge base](https://docs.rootski.io/).

An admin needs to give you write access to the repository so that you can,

- comment on "pull requests" (reviewing code written by others before it gets merged in)
- have your profile picture added to the rootski README and knowledge base
- contribute code yourself

## Project Requirements

1. If you don't have one already, create a GitHub account.

2. Go to your GitHub profile and upload a picture. This is the picture that will show
   up all over rootski after your first code gets approved.

3. Send Eric your GitHub username and email address so that he can send you an invite email.

4. Accept the invite to become a collaborator.

5. (Optional) ⭐️ leave a star on the repo 😃.
