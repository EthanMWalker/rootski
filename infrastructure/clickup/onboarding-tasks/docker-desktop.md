# ðŸ”¥ Set up Docker Desktop

## Project Context

To run Rootski locally, you're going to need Docker installed on your machine.

If you're only developing the backend and frontend, you don't *need* to understand Docker,
although it is insaAaAAanely valuable for your career in tech no matter what part
of the software stack you prefer to work on.

> ðŸ—’ Note: that *learning* Docker will be a separate, more specialized onboarding task.
> For now, you just need to be able to run docker.

> ðŸ˜¢ Note: Any version of WindowsOS that is less than the "Pro" tier can't run docker!
> If you have Windows "Home" edition, you'll need to upgrade to Pro. If you buy an official
> Microsoft activation code, this can cost ~$100.

## Project Requirements

1. Install Docker or Docker Desktop and `docker-compose`.

2. Verify that your install worked by running `docker images`. You should see an empty table.
