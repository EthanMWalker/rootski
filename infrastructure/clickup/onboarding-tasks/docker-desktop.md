# ðŸ”¥ Set up Docker Desktop

## Project Context

To run Rootski locally, you're going to need Docker installed on your machine.

If you're only developing the backend and frontend, you don't *need* to understand Docker,
although it is insaAaAAanely valuable for your career in tech no matter what part
of the software stack you prefer to work on.

## Project Requirements

1. Install Docker or Docker Desktop and `docker-compose`.

2. Verify that your install worked by running `docker images`. You should see an empty table.
