# ðŸ”¥ Add your availability to Google Calendar

## Project Context

It is *so* cool that we can all build software like Rootski remotely.

To make working remotely as easy (and cheap) as possible, we went with Google calendar to communicate
our schedules to each other.

You will need to get access to both of our team calendars (availability and meetings) and
add your own (loose) availability to it.

This way, it will be very easy for teammates to reach out to you to coordinate pair-programming
sessions. Our pair-programming tools are *sweet*!

## Project Requirements

1. Reach out to Eric with your email and accept the share links for both Google calendars.

2. Add your availability to the calendar for times you think you'll be free.
