# ðŸ”¥ Learn Trunk-based Development

## Project Context

We work with `git` by creating feature branches from `trunk` and then opening pull requests.
PRs can't be merged to `trunk` until they have "passed the build" which gets triggered
automatically when you create a PR in GitHub.

Whenever a task you are working on comes from a card in ClickUp, please create your
feature branches by clicking on the card in the ClickUp UI so that your branch is associated
with the card. You can also leave comments in the chat on the card, which makes it a lot easier
for us to continue half-finished tasks if someone did some work and then left it unfinished
for some reason.

If you are new to "trunk-based development" or "CI/CD" *please* watch the two video trainings on `git`, TBD, and ClickUp
in the [rootski YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwF2z4Iu4rabmY7RbRNetjZprLfe8qWNz).

They are called `7 - Git Training (Part 1)` and `8 - Git Training (Part 2)`.

## Project Requirements

1. (Optional) Watch the two videos on how we use git. Please do this is you have not written software in a team setting before.

2. Create a branch using *this* card in the ClickUp UI, add yourself to the `Friends` section of the README, and open a PR.

3. Have someone review your PR and then merge it.
